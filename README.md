# Padim

Padim is a Patch Distribution Modeling Framework for Anomaly Detection and Localization. And now we can do it with C#.

With the help of PadimSharp, we can train and detect in C# only.
We have tested on MVTec. 

For example:

The image to detect:

![019](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dda1aef9-9940-4952-b8bf-4d5f3907ec45)


We can get the mask:

![19_result](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e00c6435-d28e-4773-ba8c-0a72d7d898d5)
